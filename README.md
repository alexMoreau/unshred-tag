unshred-tag 
===========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dchaplinsky/unshred-tag.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dchaplinsky/unshred-tag) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/dchaplinsky/unshred-tag/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/dchaplinsky/unshred-tag?branch=master)

Flask/Mongo app to manually tag shreds. Experimental, volatile, unstable. No english translation yet, sorry.

This is companion for my unshred experiments. Allows to load results to mongo and then process and tag them manually.
Still in very early stages. Utilizes flask/mongo/heroku/s3.
